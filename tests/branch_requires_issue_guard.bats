# Unit tests for ai_clients/claude/hooks/branch_requires_issue_guard.sh
#
# Strategy:
#   - Pure stdin->exit-code filter: feed a PreToolUse JSON payload, assert 0 (allow) / 2 (block).
#   - The guard extracts a new-branch name from the command, then asks the tracker. To keep the
#     BLOCK path deterministic and offline, tests that need a tracker export
#     CLAUDE_ISSUE_TRACKER=github (the env override): a branch with NO issue number then hits
#     `block_no_ref` BEFORE any `gh` call. Tests where no branch is extracted exit 0 before the
#     tracker is ever consulted, so they need no setup.
#
# These tests pin the same-class false-positive from issue #54: the branch-name regex used to run
# greedily over the WHOLE command string, so an unrelated `-c` in a chained/piped command
# (`grep -c 'labels:'`) and a `git switch -c` mentioned inside a heredoc body were mistaken for a
# real branch creation.
#
# Run locally:  bats tests/            (install with: sudo apt-get install -y bats)

# --- #77: a foreign tracker id must fail OPEN, not false-block on a phantom GitHub issue --------
# These are the crux tests. Under github tracking, a branch whose leading slug token is a Linear /
# Jira id (hm-848, ABC-12) previously had its digits (848, 12) read as a GitHub issue number and
# was BLOCKED as a phantom. It must now exit 0 — WITHOUT ever calling `gh` (the check runs before
# ref extraction), so the test is deterministic and offline.

# The foreign-id allow is deliberately narrow: the fail-open fires only for a LEADING
# <letters>-<digits> slug token. The negative side is already locked by the no-ref BLOCK tests
# above (scratch/poke-at-it, feat/no-number, wip) — a multi-token non-foreign slug still exits 2,
# so it was NOT misread as foreign (that path exits 0). The gh-dependent "absent GitHub issue
# still blocks" path needs a live repo context, which this offline suite deliberately avoids —
# the same limitation the sibling guard suites accept.
