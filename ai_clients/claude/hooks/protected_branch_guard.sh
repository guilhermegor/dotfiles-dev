# PreToolUse (Bash matcher) hook: block a `git commit` / `git push` while HEAD is on a protected
# branch (master or main), forcing a feature-branch-first workflow.
#
# Why this exists: every user repo protects master/main — direct commits/pushes must go through
# pull -> branch -> PR. A memory note or CLAUDE.md rule ("branch first") is only advisory: nothing
# runs it before the commit. This hook is harness-run, so it turns "oops, committed on master" into
# an instant pre-commit block with a one-line remedy.
#
# Hook I/O contract (same as commit_title_length_guard.sh): silent on stdout, speaks only through
# exit code + stderr — so there is intentionally no lib/common.sh / print_status here. It fails OPEN:
# not a git repo, a detached HEAD, or any state the guard cannot resolve to a protected branch name
# exits 0 and lets the command proceed. Better to miss than to false-block a valid command.

set -u

# jq parses the hook payload; without it we cannot inspect the command, so fail open.
command -v jq >/dev/null 2>&1 || exit 0

# ponytail: two literal names cover every user repo today (memory: main/master protected
# everywhere). Make this a .git-config / env list only if a repo ever protects a differently-named
# default branch.

# Drop heredoc bodies from a command string. `grep`'s `^` anchors to ANY line start, and a heredoc
# injects lines that are line-starts but not commands — so a `git push` written inside an issue/PR
# body (`gh issue create --body "$(cat <<EOF ... EOF)"`) used to trip the verb match. The opener
# line and everything outside the heredoc is kept; only the body + terminator are removed.

# Parse ONE statement as a `git commit`/`git push` invocation (optionally rtk-prefixed) AND
# resolve which repo it actually targets — the root-cause fix for issue #97, folded into a single
# function per the issue's ask (a third instance of "the guard decided on the SESSION, not the
# ACTION's target" in this hook family; extract once, not another point patch).
#
# Two things a naive `grep '^git[[:space:]]+commit'` gets wrong, both fixed by tokenizing instead:
#   1. Verb detection: `git -C <path> commit` has flags BETWEEN `git` and `commit` — an anchored
#      regex never matches it, silently failing OPEN on exactly the commands #97 is about.
#   2. Target: `-C <path>` / `--git-dir=` / `--work-tree=` redirect git at a different repo than
#      the hook's own $PWD (the session's checkout) — the ONLY thing prior code ever inspected.
#
# `-C`/`--git-dir`/`--work-tree` always win (git honors them regardless of $PWD); otherwise the
# target is `tracked_dir` (the last `cd` seen so far in this command, from split_statements'
# caller), or "" to mean "the hook's own $PWD" — the session repo, still correct when nothing
# redirected the command. Prints "<verb> <target>" on a match; returns 1 if this statement isn't a
# `git commit`/`git push` at all (mirrors old behaviour: git as anything but the FIRST token is a
# mere mention, not a command, and is ignored).
